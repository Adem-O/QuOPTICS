Notice that the collapse or jump operator which corresponds to the de-excitation of the cavity or a photon 'leaving' to the environment is governed by $\\langle \\hat{n}_{E}\\rangle + 1$, this makes physical sense, as it ensure that a cavity with more than on excitation may still decay into the environment even if the environment is the vacuum.
