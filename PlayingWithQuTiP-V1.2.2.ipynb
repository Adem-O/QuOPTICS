These include the system separability such that for some initial time $t=0$ the combined system density operator $\\rho_W$ could be written in the separable form $\\rho_W(0) = \\rho_S(0)\\otimes\\rho_E(0) $. Furthermore we assume that environment coherence time $\\tau_E \\ll \\tau_S$ where $\\tau_S$ is the system coherence time. This is the Markov approximation and physically corresponds to the environment losing all coherence or information which was once contained cavity at such a rate significantly faster than of the cavity. This deems the information as ostensibly lost to the enthronement once it has left the cavity. Similar to the Markov approximation is the Born approximation which states that the impact of the cavity on the environment is so small that we can deem the environment separable from the system at all times and that in fact we may write $\\rho_W(t) = \\rho_S(t) \\otimes \\rho_E$.
